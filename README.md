Just another repository by euliechewy
Hello, my name is Eula and I'm new to coding. I'm not exactly sure how I got here.
From what I remember, I learned the basics of HTML when I was about 10 years old on a website-making site.
It was called piczo, which no longer exists. Then recently I decided to revisit it. Here I am,
with a desire to expand my learning, in something that I do find interesting. Let's see where this takes me and hope for the best.
